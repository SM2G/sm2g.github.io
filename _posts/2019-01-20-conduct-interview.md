In users can have many namespaces to resolve objects names. These are called schemas like in Oracle, and can be altered through the `search_path` variable. Here's how to check current search path:

### Introduction

* Introduce yourself (we often tend to overlook that one, but I think it's important)
* What did you liked about the job offer?
* What do you know about our company?

### Past experiences

* Speak about your professional experience.
* What problem did you solve in your career that you are most proud of?
* Your biggest mistake and how you reacted?

### The future

* What are the key skills you want to develop?
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

### Technical questions

It's totally up to you to prepare some technical questions for your candidates. These may vary depending on the position to fulfill.
Some classics are:

* What happens when you type an URL into a web browser?
* Explain NAT

You can also add some logic questions.

### English test

### Outro

* Thank you for your time
* Do you have any questions?
* Indication on the next step in the process.
