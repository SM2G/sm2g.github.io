Here are some tips for conducting job interviews that I gathered and compiled when I started recruiting.

### Introduction

Introduce yourself (we often tend to overlook that one, but I think it's important). Then ask a bout the job offer and the company.

* *What did you liked about the job offer?*
* *What do you know about our company?*

### Past experiences

Speak about your professional experience.

* *What problem did you solve in your career that you are most proud of?*
* *Your biggest mistake and how you reacted?*

### The future

* *What are the key skills you want to develop?*
* *Where do you see yourself in 5 years?*

### Technical questions

It's totally up to you to prepare some technical questions for your candidates. These may vary depending on the position to fulfill.
Some classics are:

* *What happens when you type an URL into a web browser?*
* *Explain NAT*
* *Any technical question that might be relevant for the position to fill...*

You can also add some logic questions.

### English test

This one is also a must and it's usually forgotten.

### Outro

* Thank you for your time (be polite).
* *Do you have any questions?*
* Indication on the next step in the process. If this hasn't been talked about already.
